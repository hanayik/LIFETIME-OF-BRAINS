# The brain scans of Taylor Hanayik
(male, white, height: 173cm)
 
This repository contains neuroimaging data of myself (Taylor Hanayik) since 2015 (age 24). The goal is that by the time I reach old age, I will have a vast collection of images to look back on, and perhaps be studied by others as a longitudinal dataset.
