# The brain scans of Taylor Hanayik
This repository contains neuroimaging data of myself (Taylor Hanayik) since 2013 (age 22). The goal is that by the time I reach old age, I will have a vast collection of images to look back on, and perhaps be studied by others as a longitudinal dataset. 

| Current age | Birth date | Height | Weight | Sex | Gender |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

# Data
[The raw NIFTI files are hosted at OSF.io](https://osf.io/kjdm3/).
- All date formats are YYYY-MM-DD
- Unit for age is years
- MRI protocols follow an easy to understand naming scheme (i.e. T1w = T1 weighted brain imaging protocol)
- Number of images means *unique* images
